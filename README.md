# Neglectful Hobbies

## Intro:

I wanna make something for my raspberry pi, so I'm making a todo list app which sends me annoying notifications to do my to's when I shoo.

## Problems to solve (Scope):

1. Calendar/Todo apps are too busy
2. Not enough accountability

## Why?
Because...
- Too much information clustered in too little space
- No incentive to complete a task
- No check ins
- No pressure for approaching deadlines

## So!
I want to...
- Ease the info dump: no more than the highest priority task showing
  1. Scoring system for tasks (based on eisenhower matrix?)
  2. Manual input allowed
- User defined rewards OR points system (for gamification)
- Notify for:
  1. Upcoming deadlines
     1. "xx:xx time left until {activity}"
     2. "Start planning for {activity}?"
  2. Missed deadlines 
     1. "Did you do {activity}?"
     2. "Reschedule {activity}?"
     3. "Start {activity} now?"
     4. "You missed date night with {activity}... call them back?"
